## Why?

I wanted to get nodetube running on podman and a portable deployment for running in either podman or kubernetes (via podman play).

## How?

### Assumptions

This assumes everything will be checked out in ```~/g```

```cd ~/g```

### Clone nodetube and nodetube-podman

```git clone https://github.com/mayeaux/nodetube```
```git clone https://github.com/bougyman/nodetube-podman```
